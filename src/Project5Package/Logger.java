 * Follow the Exercises below to complete this assignment.

• In Eclipse, or an IDE of your choice, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below. Ensure that the code compiles and runs as directed.

• Create a new repository on GitHub for this week’s assignment and push your completed code to this dedicated repo.

•  Create a video showcasing your work:

• In this video: record and present your project verbally while showing the results of the working project.   


Easy way to Create a video:  Start a meeting in Zoom, share your screen, open Eclipse with the code and your Console window, start recording & record yourself describing and running the program showing the results. When you click "End Meeting" it will save the video on your computer.

•  Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.

• This video should be done using screen share and voice over.  

• This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!

• (If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.)
